# UniFFI Swift XCFramework Template

This repo is a project template implementing [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/) package exposing Swift bindings to Rust code using [UniFFI](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs).

The Rust project and associated scripts are responsible for producing the `xcframework` and Swift source artifacts which are then checked into the `[framework]` and distributed via the Swift Package as described below.
