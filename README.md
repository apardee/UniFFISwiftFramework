# UniFFI Swift XCFramework Template

A project template bridging Rust logic to Swift using [UniFFI](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs).

The Rust project in this repository includes a few basic UniFFI proc macros used generate Swift bindings. The `[framework](framework)` directory contains the artifacts produced by UniFFI embedded in a binary `XCFramework` that can be imported into a Swift project using [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/). See the reference section for more detailed documentation on these topics.

## Building the Project

To build the contents of the resulting Swift package, run the build script in this project with:

```console
./build-swift.sh
```

The build script itself works a reasonable guide for the steps that result in the final Swift framework, but in general the process is:

1. Build the Rust project with `cargo build`.
2. Generate Swift bindings to the project with UniFFI `bindgen`.
3. Build static binaries of the project for all supported architectures required by the Swift package.
4. Bundle the static binaries and supporting Swift logic generated by the `bindgen` step into an `XCFramework`

After building the contents of the framework, the artifacts committed to this repo can then be updated and checked in with:

```console
./install-swift.sh
```
